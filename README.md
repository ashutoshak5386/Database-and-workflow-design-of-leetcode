Certainly! Here's the corrected version:

### Database Design:

1. **User Table**:
   - UserID (Primary Key)
   - Username
   - Email
   - Password
   - Other relevant user information (e.g., profile picture, bio, etc.)

2. **Problem Table**:
   - ProblemID (Primary Key)
   - Title
   - Description
   - Difficulty Level
   - Tags/Topics
   - Solutions (link to Solution Table)

3. **Solution Table**:
   - SolutionID (Primary Key)
   - UserID (Foreign Key referencing User Table)
   - ProblemID (Foreign Key referencing Problem Table)
   - Code
   - Language
   - Time Complexity
   - Space Complexity
   - Timestamp (when the solution was submitted)

4. **Submission Table**:
   - SubmissionID (Primary Key)
   - SolutionID (Foreign Key referencing Solution Table)
   - Test Cases (Input and Output)
   - Result (Accepted/Failed)
   - Execution Time
   - Memory Usage
   - Timestamp (when the submission was made)

5. **Discussion Table**:
   - DiscussionID (Primary Key)
   - UserID (Foreign Key referencing User Table)
   - ProblemID (Foreign Key referencing Problem Table)
   - Topic (e.g., Question, Solution, Explanation)
   - Content (text content of the discussion)
   - Timestamp

### Data Workflow Design:

1. **User Registration/Login**:
   - Users register with LeetCode providing necessary details.
   - Upon registration, user information is stored in the User Table.
   - For login, the system verifies user credentials against the User Table.

2. **Problem Access**:
   - Users can access problems of various difficulty levels.
   - When a user accesses a problem, relevant details are fetched from the Problem Table.

3. **Solution Submission**:
   - Users submit solutions to problems.
   - Submitted solutions are stored in the Solution Table along with relevant information.
   - Each solution submission triggers a validation process and is stored in the Submission Table.

4. **Discussion Forum**:
   - Users can participate in discussions related to problems.
   - Discussion posts are stored in the Discussion Table along with user and problem references.
   - Users can view, create, and respond to discussions.

5. **Leaderboard**:
   - Users' performance can be tracked via a leaderboard.
   - Performance metrics such as the number of problems solved, accuracy, etc., are calculated based on data from the Solution Table.

6. **Data Analysis**:
   - Data collected from user submissions, discussions, etc., can be analyzed to improve the platform.
   - Analysis might include identifying popular topics, common mistakes in solutions, etc.

7. **Notifications**:
   - Users receive notifications for activities like new discussions on problems they've attempted, updates on their submissions, etc.

This is a basic outline of how the database and data workflow might be designed for a platform like LeetCode. The actual implementation might involve additional complexity and optimizations based on the specific requirements and scale of the platform.
